# Dynamic Navigation Menu

This is the companion example for the [Dynamic Navigation Menu](https://makoserver.net/articles/Dynamic-Navigation-Menu) tutorial.

Run the example, using the Mako Server, as follows:

```
cd Dynamic-Nav-Menu
mako -l::www
```

For detailed instructions on starting the Mako Server, check out our [command line video tutorial](https://youtu.be/vwQ52ZC5RRg) and review the server's [command line options](https://realtimelogic.com/ba/doc/?url=Mako.html#loadapp) in our documentation.

After starting the Mako Server, use a browser and navigate to
http://localhost:portno, where portno is the HTTP port number used by
the Mako Server (printed in the console).

Login using username 'admin' and password 'password'

This example includes one example, which has been converted from PHP to LSP. See the [original tutorial](https://github.com/aaronpk/sample-oauth2-client/blob/master/github.php) for details and configuration requirements.


Run the example, using the Mako Server, as follows:

```
cd oauth
mako -l::sample-oauth2-client
```

For detailed instructions on starting the Mako Server, check out our [command line video tutorial](https://youtu.be/vwQ52ZC5RRg) and review the server's [command line options](https://realtimelogic.com/ba/doc/?url=Mako.html#loadapp) in our documentation.

# Dynamic Navigation Menu

This is the companion example for the [HTML Forms and LSP for Beginners](https://makoserver.net/articles/HTML-Forms-and-LSP-for-Beginners) tutorial.

Run the example, using the Mako Server, as follows:

```
cd html-form
mako -l::www
```

See the [Mako Server command line video tutorial](https://youtu.be/vwQ52ZC5RRg) for more information on how to start the Mako Server.

After starting the Mako Server, use a browser and navigate to
http://localhost:portno, where portno is the HTTP port number used by
the Mako Server (printed in the console).

Enter any value in the login field and click the Login button.

# HTML Forms and LSP for Beginners 

This is the companion example for the [HTML Forms and LSP for Beginners](https://makoserver.net/articles/HTML-Forms-and-LSP-for-Beginners) tutorial.

Run the example, using the Mako Server, as follows:

```
cd html-form
mako -l::www
```

For detailed instructions on starting the Mako Server, check out our [command line video tutorial](https://youtu.be/vwQ52ZC5RRg) and review the server's [command line options](https://realtimelogic.com/ba/doc/?url=Mako.html#loadapp) in our documentation.

After starting the Mako Server, use a browser and navigate to
http://localhost:portno, where portno is the HTTP port number used by
the Mako Server (printed in the console).

Enter any value in the login field and click the Login button.

Please note that the Mako Server (Barracuda App Server) includes advanced authentication and authorization management APIs and you would normally not create a login page as shown in this example. See the [authentication](../authentication) example for more information.

# SMQ Examples

Simple Message Queue (SMQ) is an "Internet of Things" IoT / M2M "Machine-to-Machine" publish subscribe (pub/sub) connectivity protocol specifically designed for easy and secure device management. See the [online SMQ documentation](https://realtimelogic.com/ba/doc/?url=SMQ.html) for a detailed introduction.

## SMQ API

The [SMQ documentation](https://realtimelogic.com/ba/doc/?url=SMQ.html) provides an introduction and a few basic hands-on examples.


## Lua and JavaScript Examples

* [One-to-One communication](one2one/README.md) - A foundational guide demonstrating direct communication between a browser and the server. This example serves as a versatile base for establishing browser-server interactions.
* [RPC (aka AJAX) over SMQ](RPC/README.md) - Extends the `One-to-One communication` example and includes browser-to-server RPC calls.
* [a light bulb app and a light switch app](LightSwitch-And-LightBulb-App/README.md) - The companion example for the [Modern Approach to Embedding a Web Server in a Device](https://realtimelogic.com/articles/Modern-Approach-to-Embedding-a-Web-Server-in-a-Device)
tutorial.

* [Cluster example](cluster/README.md) - Explore how to horizontally scale an SMQ solution, enhancing its capacity and reliability through redundancy

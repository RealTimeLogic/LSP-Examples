# AJAX

This is the companion example for the [Ajax for Beginners](https://makoserver.net/articles/Ajax-for-Beginners) tutorial.

Run the example, using the Mako Server, as follows:

```
cd AJAX
mako -l::www
```

For detailed instructions on starting the Mako Server, check out our [command line video tutorial](https://youtu.be/vwQ52ZC5RRg) and review the server's [command line options](https://realtimelogic.com/ba/doc/?url=Mako.html#loadapp) in our documentation.

After starting the Mako Server, use a browser and navigate to
http://localhost/. Enter some data into the input field and
watch the data being printed to the server's console and added to the
HTML page in the browser.

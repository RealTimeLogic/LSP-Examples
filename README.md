## Linux Users

Most of the examples include hidden files and/or directories. With the
Barracuda App Server, resources starting with a dot are hidden and
cannot be accessed by an HTTP client such as a browser. The resources
can only be accessed on the server side. To make sure you see all
resources, use the Linux command: ls -a

# File Upload

The two examples blocking and asynchronous show how to upload data
using drag and drop and standard file upload. The drag and drop upload
is powered by JavaScript on the client side, and the standard upload
uses an HTML form with the input type "file".

The examples focus on uploading firmware, but can be used as a
template for uploading any type of data.

The asynchronous upload example uses a more complex API and should
only be used if a large number of concurrent uploads is required.

Note that you may also consider using the ready to use [Web File Manager](https://realtimelogic.com/ba/doc/?url=lua.html#ba_create_wfs). You may test the Web File Manager using the [online tutorial](https://tutorial.realtimelogic.com/fs/).

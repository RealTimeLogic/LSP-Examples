# Asynchronous Upload

This example shows how to use [ba.create.upload()](http://realtimelogic.com/ba/doc/?url=en/lua/lua.html#ba_create_upload) for creating an upload directory object, which can accept a large number of concurrent uploads.

![Blocking Upload](www/doc/overview.png "Asynchronous Upload")

Run the example, using the Mako Server, as follows:

```
cd upload/blocking
mako -l::www
```

For detailed instructions on starting the Mako Server, check out our [command line video tutorial](https://youtu.be/vwQ52ZC5RRg) and review the server's [command line options](https://realtimelogic.com/ba/doc/?url=Mako.html#loadapp) in our documentation.
